-----------
Use github's pull requests to contribute code.

We follow the [Google C++ Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html)
wherever possible, with the exception that we use 4 spaces instead of 2. If
your code is drifting too far to the right, it probably needs to be refactored.
